    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Adel Zaalouk, a free-style researcher who cares more about knowledge than titles.
      I currently work as a Product Manager with a technical focus on all things Cloud, AI, and Kubernetes.
      I am also one of the Cloud Native AI working group technical leads.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my career I wore different hats, in different countries working with different people
      from a broad spectrum of nationalities. Initially, I started in research with a strong focus on
      Software-Defined Networking (back in the buzz days), and moved slowly to the industry side,
      covering / advocating for software-defined concepts across the entire stack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nowadays, I work mostly with cloud, control-planes, and AI, paving my way through the AI stack
      with a researchy attitude. I love tinkering around with new tech, and sharing my learnings.
      I share my learnings either in the form of blog-posts, publications, talks, or in meet-ups where
      I get to meet and learn from awesome minded people in the community. These days, I muse a lot at
      <a href="https://thetechnomist.com/">"The Technomist"</a>, a newsletter I started with the hope
      of bridging the gap between tech and business mindsets.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also like to organize meetups, so I started quite a few. Truth be told, some are not active
      anymore but dear to my heart to shut-down (maybe there is a future to them?).
