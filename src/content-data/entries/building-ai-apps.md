Building AI applications has become more accessible than ever. In this post, I'll share my experience working with large language models and the patterns that have emerged.

## Getting Started

The first step is choosing the right framework...

## Key Patterns

When building AI applications, consider:

1. **Prompt Engineering** - The art of crafting effective prompts
2. **Context Management** - Handling conversation history
3. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation when APIs fail

## Conclusion

The future of AI development is bright, and Python remains the language of choice.
