### AI Technology Trends

In a [previous article,](https://thetechnomist.com/p/beyond-llms-compounds-systems-agents) we explored the idea of compound AI systems as key building blocks in the making of whole products. We discussed agents/agentic, RAG, and other enabling technologies. These technologies emerged from trends through which the next generation of AI products will be made of, including those for AI security. These trends/technologies will be used to amplify a system's security but are also systems that need to be secured. For example:

  * **Long-context reasoning** : By leveraging long-context models, AI security systems can analyze vast amounts of data over extended time periods, identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate emerging threats. This can be important for detecting sophisticated attacks that may involve slow, subtle manipulations over time. For instance, detecting insider threats that gradually escalate privileges or analyzing long-term trends in network traffic to identify subtle deviations indicative of a compromise.

  * **Text-to-action** : Combining long-context reasoning with text-to-action capabilities allows AI security systems to not only identify threats but also automatically generate and execute appropriate responses. For example, an AI system could analyze a complex security incident report, identify the root cause, and automatically initiate actions like isolating infected devices, patching vulnerabilities, or alerting relevant personnel.

  * **Agents/Agentic** will enhance AI security by enabling proactive and autonomous threat detection and response. These AI agents can continuously monitor systems, analyze data, and adapt to evolving threats, automatically triggering remediation actions to neutralize attacks. They can also conduct proactive threat hunting, automate investigations, personalize security policies based on user behavior and context, and improve collaboration between AI systems and human analysts. Ultimately, agents/agentic technology empowers organizations to build more robust and resilient security systems that can effectively combat the ever-growing complexity of cyber threats.

These new AI trends/technologies can be integrated into security products to enhance their effectiveness. For example, integrating agent-based threat detection into a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system can improve its ability to identify and respond to threats in real-time. Similarly, incorporating long-context reasoning into vulnerability management tools can enable predictive analysis and proactive patching.
