> With the benefit of hindsight, the field of artificial intelligence stems from the research originally done on Hopfield nets, Boltzmann machines, the backprop algorithm, and reinforcement learning. However, the evolution of backprop networks into deep learning networks had to wait for three related developments:1) much faster computers, 2) massively bigger training data sets, and, 3) incremental improvements in learning algorithms ~ from A Very Short History of Artificial Neural Networks | by James V Stone
