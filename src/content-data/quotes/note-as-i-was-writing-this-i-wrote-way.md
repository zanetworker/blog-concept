> Note: As I was writing this, I wrote way more sections than I should have, so I decided to break it down into two parts (it will not likely fit an E-mail anyway). This here is part I, in part II, we will compare and contrast history and present, look at AI and innovations in general from the business and economic perspective, and brainstorm on how to build better products catering to a larger group of consumers from the lessons learned in part I.
