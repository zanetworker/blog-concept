# The Boy and the Infinite Room

Leo sat in the center of his bedroom, a small kingdom of beige carpet and white walls. To anyone else, it was just a room. To Leo, it was a blank canvas waiting for a spark. It started with a hum—a low, vibrating sound coming from beneath his bed. He peeked under, expecting a lost toy, but found a glowing, azure light pulsing against the floorboards.

As he reached for it, the light expanded, washing over the room. The beige carpet didn't just change color; it liquefied. Suddenly, Leo wasn't sitting on a rug; he was drifting on a raft made of his throw pillows, bobbing gently on a bioluminescent sea. The air smelled of salt and starlight.

He looked up. His bookshelf, once filled with comics and encyclopedias, twisted and groaned, stretching upwards. The wood turned to bark, the pages to leaves. Within seconds, a towering ancient jungle canopy replaced his ceiling. Colorful birds with feathers like neon lights swooped down, chattering in languages Leo felt he could almost understand.

Leo grabbed a vine (which looked suspiciously like his lamp cord) and swung from his raft onto the mossy banks of his bed-island. He wasn't just Leo the boy anymore; he was Leo the Explorer, mapping the edges of a world that existed only for him. He spent what felt like hours climbing the highest branches of the Shelf Trees, spotting distant mountains made of laundry piles and valleys of scattered Lego bricks.

But then, a voice boomed from the sky—or rather, from the hallway. "Leo! Dinner!" The jungle shimmered. The ocean stilled. The world folded back into itself like an intricate origami trick. Leo blinked, finding himself back on the beige carpet. The glowing light was gone, but in his hand, he held a single, impossible bright blue shell. The adventure was over, but the magic remained.
